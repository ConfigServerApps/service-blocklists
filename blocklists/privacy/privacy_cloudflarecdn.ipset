#   Cloudflare operates as a content delivery network (CDN) that
#   provides tools to improve website performance and reliability.
#   When a domain is added to Cloudflare, site traffic is routed
#   through Cloudflare's global network of data centers.
#   
#   Cloudflare speeds up content delivery by caching static assets
#   such as CSS, JavaScript, and images on its servers. Content is
#   served from the data center closest to the visitor, reducing
#   page load times. If a server is under heavy load, traffic is
#   automatically routed to the next closest location.
