#   This list contains IP addresses associated with Fastly.
#   
#   Fastly operates as a content delivery network (CDN), similar to
#   Cloudflare. It caches and serves content such as CSS, JavaScript,
#   static pages, and other cacheable assets.
#   
#   Fastly is not typically a service you would want to block. Its IP
#   addresses are not used for port scanning, SSH brute-force attempts,
#   or other abusive behavior, and are intended solely for content
#   delivery.
