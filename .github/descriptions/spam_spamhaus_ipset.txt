#   The Spamhaus Project is an international organization based in the
#   Principality of Andorra, founded in 1998 by Steve Linford to track
#   email spammers and spam-related activity across the Internet.
#   
#   The DROP (Don't Route Or Peer) lists are a subset of the Spamhaus
#   Blocklist (SBL), created to provide complete protection from all
#   malicious activity originating from the listed networks across all
#   Internet protocols. This includes traffic targeting these networks,
#   such as access to websites hosted within them.
#   
#   DROP only includes netblocks allocated directly by established
#   Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) or National Internet Registries
#   (NIRs), including ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC, and KRNIC,
#   or via direct RIR allocations.
#   
#   The list contains over 1,300 subnets and more than 1,590,000 unique
#   IP addresses.
