#   The master list is the primary and recommended list in this repository.
#   It is the best choice for most users who want to block known malicious
#   actors from accessing their servers.
#   
#   This list aggregates multiple trusted sources into a single, validated
#   dataset. Each IP included has been confirmed to be associated with
#   malicious activity such as port scanning, brute-force attacks, DDoS
#   attempts, DNS poisoning, fraud, spam operations, or compromised hosts.
#   
#   Legitimate infrastructure providers such as Cloudflare, Amazon, or
#   Microsoft should not be blocked by this list unless a specific server
#   instance was abused by a third party for malicious purposes.
#   
#   This auto-generated list includes IPs involved in:
#      - AbuseIPDB (100% confidence)
#      - IPThreat.net (70% confidence)
#      - Port scanning and sniffing
#      - Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
#      - Brute-force attacks (SSH, FTP, etc.)
#      - Malicious web bots
#      - IP and protocol spoofing
#      - DNS poisoning attacks
#      - IoT device targeting
#      - Fraudulent activity
#      - Web application attacks
