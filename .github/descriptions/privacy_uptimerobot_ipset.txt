#   UptimeRobot API
#   
#   UptimeRobot is a service that monitors your websites’ uptime and sends
#   alerts when a site goes down. By integrating UptimeRobot with RunCloud,
#   you can track all websites hosted on RunCloud servers and leverage
#   features from both platforms.
#   
#   The service works by sending requests to your sites at regular intervals,
#   checking response status codes, response times, and keyword presence.
#   If a response is unsatisfactory, UptimeRobot notifies you via email, SMS,
#   webhooks, or other preferred methods.
