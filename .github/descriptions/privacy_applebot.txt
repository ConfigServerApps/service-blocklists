#   Applebot Blocklist
#   
#   Applebot is Apple’s web crawler, designed to index content for Apple
#   services such as Siri, Spotlight Suggestions, and Apple News. It scans
#   websites to gather information that powers search results, recommendations,
#   and content previews across Apple devices and apps.
#   
#   Applebot-Extended specifically enhances indexing for Apple News and other
#   content-rich services. This blocklist prevents Applebot from crawling or
#   accessing your server, stopping its data collection and indexing activities.
